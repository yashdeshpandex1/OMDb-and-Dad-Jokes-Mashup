#ðŸŽ¬ OMDb Movie Metadata Fetcher with Caching

A Python script that fetches movie metadata from the OMDb API using a custom caching system. This is a Coursera course project from the course "Data Collection and Processing with Python". Designed for educational use without requiring an API key, the tool prioritizes efficiency by checking a permanent cache before making live API calls. If a response is missing, it fetches the data, stores it in a temporary cache, and uses it for future requests.
