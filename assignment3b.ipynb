If there aren't any, it will proceed to the next longest word, and so on, until it finds a word for which there are jokes. If there is more than one word of the same length, try words that are earlier in the description first (which `sorted` does by default, since it's \"stable\" and will only move things around the minimum necessary).\n",

Your code should extend this by sorting `words` from longest to shortest and use the sorted list (and the `get_joke_data` function that you defined above) to find the longest word with associated jokes. If there are no words with associated jokes, your function should return the tuple `(None, None)`. If there is a word with associated jokes, your function should return a tuple with (1) the longest word with a joke and (2) a list of jokes associated with that word (as a list of strings)."
